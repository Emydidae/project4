The dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/856/higher+education+students+performance+evaluation) was tested, but ultimately failed to produce a succesful result, due to the relatively small size of the dataset. Work done with this dataset can be found in the "unused_dataset" sub-folders.
